Hi! I am Gaurav Arora.
</br>

I am pursuing a Masters of Science (Computer Science) under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/tbaldwin/">Timothy Baldwin</a>. My master's research project focuses on Catastrophic Forgetting in Neural Networks. Our empirical study comparing different architecture like CNN, and LSTM for forgetting was accepted in ALTA 2019.

I have been offering consultancy services for <a href="https://xapian.org/">Xapian</a> from 2014. Please find a list of my Xapian related projects [here]({{< ref "xapian.md">}}). I was a Google Summer of Code Intern with Xapian in 2012. I wrote journal during GSOC [here](http://gsocxapian.blogspot.com/).

Before joining Masters, I was a co-founder of a Mobile application startup focusing on offline retail in India.
