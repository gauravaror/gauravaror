I offer commercial development support for Xapian since 2014. I have developed the following capabilities in Xapian commercially:

* Decoupled indexing and text extraction, which drastically reducing indexing time.
* Enabled indexing of images using tesseract.
* I have designed and implemented a heuristic algorithm to [extract table](https://github.com/gauravaror/TableExtrac) from images.
* I have implemented the [Language Modelling based ranking scheme](https://github.com/xapian/xapian/blob/1c3d424b5e7f2350235a13a7b120f380ccf05567/xapian-core/include/xapian/weight.h#L1505) in Xapian (GSOC).
* I have developed an [evaluation framework](https://github.com/xapian/xapian-evaluation) for Xapian.
