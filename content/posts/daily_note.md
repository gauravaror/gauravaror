=============

* Implemented regression model using transformers for commonlit readability challenge, which isn't working. Copied code from [notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/rhtsingh/speeding-up-transformer-w-optimization-strategies), which is able to train well. Will try to debug my implementation.
* Learned about *with* and context managers in python. *with* statements are pretty cool ad useful construct. Read more about it on [realpython](https://realpython.com/python-with-statement/)
* Participated in Weekly leetcode contest, got a really bad rank and got stuck in question with circular array.
