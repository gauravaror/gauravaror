# Python Concept: One day at a time #


## Python dunder methods ##

Python functions which start with double underscore are known as dunder -- du(double) under(underscore) functions. They are majorly used for overridding the functionality of class in pythong (think OOPs).

If you define a new class. When you try printing this class instance, python prints a cryptic string which contains the name of the class and it's memory address. You can implement `__repr__` function to define how it should be printed.

You can also implement `__add__` to define the behaviour how adding something to the object should work.


## Class Objects

Variable which are defined directly inside the class are called class variable. You can access them via self itself.
