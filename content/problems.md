## [Trapping Rain Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/)

## [Kth Largest element in an array](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-largest-element-in-an-array/)

## [Linked List Cycle](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/)
[Solution](https://github.com/gauravaror/programming/blob/master/linked_list_cycle.py)

There are two type of solution for identifying Linked List cycle.
First solution is to maintain the hash table of element seen till now and if you see an element again then you know linked list have cycles but this required O(n) space.

Better solution is to keep two pointers one fast and one slow. Fast pointer moves two element at a list and slow moves one element at a time.
If you reach a node with no further element then linked list doesn't have cycle but if fast and slow runner both reach a same element then they have cycles.
